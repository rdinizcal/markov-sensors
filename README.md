# Self-Organized Mapping for Environmental Non-determinism Simulation at WEKA

This repository contains the code implementation for the technical titled "Self-Organized Mapping for environmental non-determinism simulation at WEKA".
The goal of the project is to model vital signs from a dataset available online to simulate non-deterministic input for body sensor networks.

## Abstract

Environmental non-determinism demands complex reasoning mechanisms for systems eager to achieve goals on partially-observable and unknown environments. Lately, scientists have been exploring software capable of reorganizing its own internal structure to cope with environmental uncertainties, however itâ€™s not trivial to apply the methods and techniques to developed self-adaptive systems as they may present unpredictable behavior if adaptations are not well validated in design phase. In our study group, we developed a simulation of a Body Sensor Network system with vital signal generation through probabilistic models to simulate environmental non-determinism. In the current study, we apply an one-dimensional self-organized mapping neural network for clustering heart rate data values into ranges that will represent the markov chain states.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The code asks for the following libraries:

 - matplotlib
 - numpy
 - scipy
 - sklearn

### Running the code

```bash
$ cd code/
$ python main.py
```

As output, you should expect a file containing a markov chain represented with a transition matrix in a file named \[vitalsign\]_mc.txt.
